# When I click the link "Update Parent"
# Then I am taken to '/parents/:id/edit' where I  see a form to edit the parent's attributes:
# When I fill out the form with updated information
# And I click the button to submit the form
# Then a `PATCH` request is sent to '/parents/:id',
# the parent's info is updated,
# and I am redirected to the Parent's Show page where I see the parent's updated info
